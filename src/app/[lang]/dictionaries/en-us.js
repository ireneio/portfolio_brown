      A lottery network platform for customers to deposit, place bets, and withdraw funds, with an integrated user discussion forum and automated betting robots, complemented by an agent system to implement downstream profit-sharing among users.
      <br/><br/>Tech stack included the use of VueJS combined with SCSS, with separated desktop and mobile applications. This includes creating betting logic for various lotteries, such as composite lotteries and Macau lotteries, as well as designing more complex frontend interfaces such as "bead roads" and trend charts. Implemented features include automatic betting, member reward systems, platform customer service, event notifications, and user discussion forums. Additionally, payment functions like online QR code payments and deposit functions through exchanges were developed. A frontend skin-changing feature was implemented, allowing different CSS styles to be swapped with animations under the same logic to achieve skin changes.
      <br/><br/>I was responsible for setting up the initial code architecture and establishing code standards. Managed the frontend task allocation and personnel scheduling for the sub-projects of this project. After successfully launching the project, continued to maintain and operate the frontend of the project, including collecting user feedback for optimization and customization adjustments. The project, once launched, achieved a significant improvement in loading speed and user experience compared to previous products, successfully increasing user retention and thereby boosting product revenue.
